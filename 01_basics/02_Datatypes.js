// Different data types in JavaScript

// Number => up to 2^53 - 1
// BigInt => for larger integers
// String => text, enclosed in quotes ""
// Boolean => true or false
// Null => a standalone value representing "nothing"
// Undefined => a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value
// Symbol => a unique and immutable primitive value, often used as object property keys

// Object => a complex data type used to store collections of data and more complex entities

// Checking the types of null and undefined
console.log(typeof null); // Output: "object" (this is a well-known JavaScript quirk)
console.log(typeof undefined); // Output: "undefined"
